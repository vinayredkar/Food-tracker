This project was developed for the course of Web Languages and Technologies (LTW) of the Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering (MIEIC) at FEUP. The main goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to search for food and restaurants, as well as to create their own restaurants. 

Below, you can find some screenshots of the application:

### Project Developmentüìù

The first thing we did was defining the UML diagram of the database. We started by defining the entities and their attributes, as well as the relationships between them. After that, we defined the database schema and created the database. 

Then, we created wireframes with the main features to decide where to fit each feature. After that, we created the hi-fi mockups, which are the ones that we used to develop the project. We used Figma for this task, since it has a lot of features that allow us to create a very realistic mockup with clicks and transitions.

We started by creating the login and register pages, as well as the database functions to register and login users. After that, we created the profile page, where users can edit their profile information. 

Then, we created the restaurant page, where users can see the restaurant information, as well as the dishes and reviews. We also created the restaurant owner page, where restaurant owners can see the reviews of their restaurant and answer to them.
